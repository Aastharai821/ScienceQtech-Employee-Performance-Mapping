# ScienceQtech-Employee-Performance-Mapping

## Introduction
This project, “ScienceQtech Employee Performance Mapping,” leverages MySQL Workbench 8.0 to organize, analyze, and generate insights from employee data for a data science startup. The data includes employee records, project details, and the data science team’s information. The primary aim is to facilitate effective performance mapping for the annual appraisal cycle by structuring data for efficient analysis. With organized tables, complex queries, and performance optimizations, this project effectively enables decision-making on employee appraisals, salary distributions, and departmental performance.

## Problem Statement
ScienceQtech requires a well-structured database to manage employee details, track performance, and analyze attributes such as experience, rating, and departmental distributions. The project uses SQL queries and MySQL features to extract insights for the HR department to help with employee appraisal and performance tracking.

## Objectives
+ Structure and format the data within a MySQL database.
+ Generate an ER diagram for clear visualization of relationships.
